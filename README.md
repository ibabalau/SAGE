# SAGE (IntruSion alert-driven Attack Graph Extractor)
Repository to accompany our publications 

"SAGE: Intrusion Alert-driven Attack Graph Extractor" at VizSec'21, and

"Alert-driven Attack Graph Generation using S-PDFA" at TDSC'21.

## Requires 
- Flexfringe (https://github.com/tudelft-cda-lab/FlexFringe)
- Python packages
  - Graphviz
  - Seaborn
  - Requests
  - [Optional] Fastai (1.0.58)
  - [Optional] Spacy 2.3.5

**Or you can switch to the `docker` branch for a docker container.**


## Usage
`python sage.py {path/to/json/files} {experiment-name} {alert-filtering-window} {alert-aggr-window} {(start_hour,end_hour)}`

- `{path/to/json/files}`: folder containing intrusion alerts in json format. `sample-input.json` provides an example of accepted file format. 
> Ideal setting: One json file for each attacker/team. Filename considered as attacker/team label. 
- `{experiment_name}`: custom name for all artefacts
> Figures, trace files, model files, attack graphs are saved with this prefix for easy identification. 
- `{alert_filtering_window}`: time window in which duplicate alerts are discarded (default: 1.0 sec)
- `{alert_aggr_window}`: aggregate alerts occuring in this window as one episode (default: 150 sec)
- [Optional] `{(start_hour,end_hour)}`: Time range (in hours). A floating-point tuple limiting the alerts that are parsed and involved in the final attack graphs. 
> If not provided, the default values of (0,100) are used, meaning alerts from 0-th to 100-th hour (relative to the start of the alert capture) are parsed.

## First time use

- In `sage.py`, set paths to `flexfringe/` executable, and `path_to_ini` variable.
- A sample alert file is provided with the name `sample-input.json` (T5 alerts from CPTC-2018) to test SAGE. Use the following command: 

`python sage.py alerts/ firstExp 1.0 150`

where `alerts/` contains `sample-input.json`.
